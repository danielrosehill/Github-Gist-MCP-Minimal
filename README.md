# GitHub Gist MCP (Minimal)

A minimal MCP server for creating and managing GitHub Gists. Provides just 4 essential tools to keep context usage low.

Forked from [gistpad-mcp](https://github.com/lostintangent/gistpad-mcp) by lostintangent.

## Why This Fork?

The original gistpad-mcp is feature-rich but provides 27+ tools, which floods MCP context. This minimal fork reduces it to just 4 core operations:

- Create private gists
- Create public gists (with auto-appended verification notice)
- Update gists
- Delete gists

## Getting Started

1. Generate a GitHub personal access token with the `gist` scope: https://github.com/settings/tokens/new

2. Add to your MCP client config:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "github-gist": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "github-gist-mcp-minimal"],
      "env": {
        "GITHUB_TOKEN": "<YOUR_PAT>"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

## Tools

| Tool | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `create_private_gist` | Create a new private GitHub Gist |
| `create_public_gist` | Create a new public GitHub Gist (includes verification footer) |
| `update_gist` | Update the content of a file in a gist |
| `delete_gist` | Delete a GitHub Gist by ID |

### Public Gist Footer

Public gists automatically include a footer noting they were generated by Claude Code and advising readers to verify the content.
